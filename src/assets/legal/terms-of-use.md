4. **Use of Services – ENSF Interface**
   1. The decentralised open source blockchain based naming protocol known as the Ethereum Name Service (“**Protocol**”) maintains a registry of all domains and subdomains based on the Ethereum blockchain through a series of smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. Users may, through interacting with the Protocol, search such registry, register domains and subdomains and manage their registered names. The Interface is one, but not the exclusive, means of accessing the Protocol. You are responsible for conducting your own diligence on interfaces enabling you to access the Protocol to understand the fees and risks that they present.
   2. Although legal entities associated with or engaged by ENSF (including the Subcontractors) may have developed much of the initial code for the Protocol, they, and ENSF do not provide, own, or control the Protocol, which is run by smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. Upgrades and modifications to the Protocol are managed in a community-driven way by holders of the Ethereum Name Service token.
   3. **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: By accessing or using the Protocol whether via the Interface or otherwise, you hereby forbear to sue ENSF (including for the avoidance of doubt the Subcontractors), its employees, directors, agents and/or any of its affiliates for any losses, damages or costs incurred or which may be incurred by you as a result of use of the Interface and/or Protocol. You expressly acknowledge that no developer or entity involved in creating and deploying the Protocol will be liable for any claims or damages whatsoever associated with your use, inability to use, or your interaction with other users of, the Protocol, including without limitation any direct, indirect, special, incidental, exemplary or consequential damages, or loss of profits, business or goodwill, digital assets, or anything else of value and hereby release ENSF, the Subcontractors, each of its/their employees, directors, agents and/or any of its/their affiliates from responsibility, liability, claims, demands and/or damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown (including, but not limited to, claims of negligence), arising out of or related to the use of the Interface and/or Protocol. **
   4. You must not use our Interface in any of the manners set out in Clause 3.1 above, which shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ to use of our Interface.
   5. **You understand that anyone can register and own a domain name (and its subdomains) that is not already registered on the registry maintained by the Protocol. You further understand that names registered on the registry maintained by the Protocol may expire and you are responsible for monitoring and renewing the registration of such names. As mentioned in Clause 4.2 above, you acknowledge that ENSF and its Subcontractors are not able to forcibly remove, prevent or otherwise interfere with the ability of any person to register a domain name on the registry operated by the Protocol and, without prejudice to the generality of Clause 4.3 and Clause 6 herein, you hereby forbear to sue ENSF, the Subcontractors, each of its/their employees, directors, agents and/or any of its/their affiliates, and acknowledge that ENSF and the Subcontractors will not be liable for any claims or damages whatsoever associated with your use, inability to use any domain names subject of registration, or to be registered, on the registry maintained by the Protocol. **
   6. You agree that the Interface is a purely non-custodial application, meaning you are solely responsible for the custody of the cryptographic private keys to the digital asset wallets you hold. These Terms of Use are not intended to, and does not, create or impose any fiduciary duties on us. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you acknowledge and agree that we owe no fiduciary duties or liabilities to you or any other party, and that to the extent any such duties or liabilities may exist at law or in equity, those duties and liabilities are hereby irrevocably disclaimed, waived, and foregone. You further agree that the only duties and obligations that we owe you are those set out expressly in these Terms of Use.
   7. You acknowledge and accept that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems such as Ethereum are variable and may increase dramatically at any time.
   8. The Interface may contain references or links to third-party resources, including (but not limited to) information, materials, products, or services, that we do not own or control. In addition, third parties may offer promotions related to your access and use of the Interface. We do not endorse or assume any responsibility for any such resources or promotions. If you access any such resources or participate in any such promotions, you do so at your own risk, and you understand that these Terms of Use do not apply to your dealings or relationships with any third parties. You expressly relieve us of any and all liability arising from your use of any such resources or participation in any such promotions.

To use any parts of the contents of our Interface other than for personal and non-commercial use, the user must seek permission from ENSF and/or the relevant third party in writing. ENSF reserves the right to refuse permission without providing any reasons.

   10. We may require you to enter into separate written agreements with us to use our Interface. In such an event, the Terms of Service are to be read together with such written agreements but the written agreements will prevail in the event of any express conflict or inconsistency.
