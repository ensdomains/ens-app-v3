3. **How We Collect Your Personal Data**
   1. We use different methods to collect data from and about you including through:
      1. **Direct interactions. **You may give us your Contact, Profile and Public Blockchains Data by filling in forms, corresponding with us by email, our official chatrooms, communication channels or other interaction methods. This includes Personal Data you provide when you:

We collect this Personal Data by using cookies, pixel tags, server logs and other similar technologies. Pixel tags (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs), allow us to analyse how users find our services, make the services more useful to you, and tailor your experience with us to meet your particular interests and needs.
      3. **Third parties or publicly available sources.** We will receive Personal Data about you from various third parties and public sources that offer their products and/or services for use in conjunction with our service or whose products and/or services may be linked from our service. For example, third-party wallet providers provide us with your blockchain address and certain other information you choose to share with those wallet providers. We may add this to the data we have already collected from or about you through our service.
4. **Cookies and Third Party Websites**
   1. Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. Cookies are small text files placed in visitors’ computer browsers to store their preferences and record certain information. They may have unique identifiers, and reside, among other places, on your computer or mobile device, in emails and on our web pages. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to analyse how you interact with our website and use our services, make improvements to our service quality, and provide users with a more personalised experience. Through the use of cookies, we provide users of the websites with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.
   2. We may engage third party service providers to assist in recording your usage patterns, trends and customise your experience, or use cookies on our websites to collect the same type of Personal Data for the same purposes we do for ourselves. We do not have access to or control over the cookies these third parties use but they may not disclose personal data obtained in the course of their engagement to any other parties. Additionally, we may share non-personally identifiable personal data with third parties.
   3. For the avoidance of doubt, we shall not be responsible for the collection, use, disclosure and care of Personal Data by any third party websites (including third party operated communication channels such as Discord) linked to our websites.
   4. We may use the following cookies:
      1. Strictly necessary cookies. These are cookies that are required for the operation of our websites. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our websites.
      2. Analytical/performance cookies. They allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our websites when they are using it. This may help us to improve the way our websites work, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.
      3. Functionality cookies. These cookies are used to recognise you when you return to our websites. They may enable us to personalise our content for you, greet you by name, or remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).
      4. Targeting cookies. These cookies record your visit to our websites, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed.
   5. You may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our websites by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore, previously set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all popular Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, it may not be possible to use all the functions of our websites.
   6. By continuing to browse or use our websites, you are agreeing to our use of cookies as well as our cookie policy set out in this Clause 4.

9. **How Your Personal Data is Protected**
   1. To safeguard your Personal Data from unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks, and against the accidental loss of, or damage to, Personal Data, we have put in place appropriate administrative, physical, security and technical measures from the point of collection to the point of destruction. Some of the measures we have put in place are set out as follows:
      1. We ensure that all our directors, employees, contractors, agents, and subcontractors comply with this Policy, and that they have access to your Personal Data on a need-to- know basis.
      2. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
      3. Personal Data will only be transferred to a third-party data intermediary if there is agreement by them to comply with our practice and procedures.
   2. You should be aware, however, that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure. While security cannot be guaranteed, we strive to protect the security of your information and are constantly reviewing and enhancing our information security measures.
10. **How We Keep Your Personal Data Accurate**
    1. We generally rely on Personal Data provided by you (or your authorised representative).

    2. We will cease to retain your Personal Data, or remove the means by which the data can be associated with you, as soon as it is reasonable to assume that such retention no longer serves the purpose for which the Personal Data was collected, and is no longer necessary for legal or business purposes.
    3. It may sometimes be necessary to retain Personal Data if, for example, we are contractually bound to do so or if we have become involved in litigation or business disaster recovery in respect of which your Personal Data is relevant.
